# Cleaning Robot

## Proposal

The proposal document is available in the `/attached_files` folder as a PDF.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a cleaning robot with autonomous navigation capabilities. The robot utilizes frontier exploration for mapping and voice control for operational commands. 

## Update: Week Oct. 30 - Nov. 5

- **Implemented**: 
  - Frontier exploration using the `explore_lite` package, which generates real-time maps.
  - Voice control functionalities for basic commands.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. **Integrate** all functions to demonstrate a complete working system.
  2. **Develop custom exploration and planning code** to better suit practical applications, focusing on enhancing efficiency and adaptability.

## Update: Week Nov. 5 - Nov. 13

- **Implemented**:
  - **Global Path Planning**: Integrated `full_coverage_path_planner` to design an efficient path covering the entire workspace, ensuring thorough cleaning coverage with minimal retracing.
  - **Path Tracking Control**: Implemented motion control with `tracking_pid` for precise path-following capabilities. This feature improves the robot's accuracy in adhering to planned paths, enabling smooth and responsive navigation along coverage paths.

- **Next Steps**:
  1. **System Integration**: Integrate `explore_lite`, `full_coverage_path_planner`, and `tracking_pid` functionalities for a fully autonomous demonstration, combining exploration, global path planning, and motion control.
  2. **Demo Preparation**: Prepare a complete demo that showcases exploration, global coverage, and path-following capabilities in a unified system.
